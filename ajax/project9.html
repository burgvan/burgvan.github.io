	    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text"><p>This is a television application owned by Sony called Crackle that embraces a whole new, creative viewing experience for their users. I was involved in the early discovery/ideation stages of this project within a team of two other interaction designers. We analyzed current wireframes given by a third party that needed a lot of improvement, brainstormed new ideas, researched requirements on various TV platforms, created experience maps, and new wireframes. I assisted the UX researcher with an A/B usability testing of two variations of a prototype with browsing experiences that are passive and active, which resulted users to prefer the passive experience more due to it re-tracing their steps within the interface while navigating through content in the next 'lane' of movies or shows rather than maintaining a position in the next 'lane'. They also liked that this behaviour wasn't changing the content in the background while navigating through the content in the interface. For more information on the results, here is a <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B3xfCBiG6nG7Wm55N3R3cEhyWjQ">report</a> that I assisted in creating and summarizing the results.</p> 

	    <p>We noticed a lot of visual affordances were missing in the current concepts and lack of consistent flows between screens such as finding a show from the search screen to finding another show after seeing the detailed information screen of the show. The two types of searching experiences (browsing shows/genres with featured items vs quick search of shows/genres) needed to be divided to not confuse the user. I also documented the wireframes and flows for the developers.</p>

	    <p>The lead of this project was Matthew Ernst at You.i and this application is powered by You.i Engine.</p>
