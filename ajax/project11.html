	    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text"><p>While working for my client Nova Networks, I redesigned a health portal for the patients and health professionals of West Carleton Family Health Team. I was the design lead for this project where I used an iterative approach through design and front-end development in a duration of 2 months. The goal was to change the interface to be more user-friendly for a primary target audience of 50+ with better information structure with less scattered information and information that is appropriately combined under less categories with better naming conventions. This way they would be able to use the portal with less friction as well as making it cross-compatible.</p> 

	    <p>Though research was quite limited for this project due to the timeline and budget, I managed to squeeze in some time to look at existing case studies online on healthcare dashboard and design patterns, and gathering anymore requirements I can get from the client regarding common target audiences and types of data that is necessary and unnecessary due to overload of information that can slow down the experience. Based on the case studies I read, emulating the online experience to the physical environment of a doctor's office or hospital office would help doctors and nurses recognize patterns easily, therefore understanding the information quicker. Goal setting is another common feature in healthcare dashboards to allow users to keep track of their health issues and improve overall health, and this feature was then added to West Carleton's health portal. Another thing I considered based on the primary user base being 50+, I made sure that bold colour contrasting was integrated.</p>
