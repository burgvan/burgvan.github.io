	    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text"><p>At Plastic Mobile, a senior UX designer and I worked closely together on making usability improvements on the Royal LePage mobile application. Requirements and data were discussed prior to working on the challenges that needed to be met through iterative design and usability analysis. I made the design changes which received a couple of rounds of feedback. Once the new designs were approved, I documented the designs and answered any concerns that developers had.</p>
	   	<p>The major design improvements were to add an ability to compare listings as well as creating categories for saved listings. These additions needed then to be considered throughout the app experience as well as including these new actions to the property detail pages. These additions will help increase conversion rates as well as retain their users since it is trying to be in line with their competitors but with more unique features.</p></div>
