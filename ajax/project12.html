	    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text"><p>I worked in the initial stages and discovery stages for a project with Macadamian Technologies that keeps track of usersâ€™ performance and workouts and enabling them to compete with others in a social fitness environment with connected technology. My role in the team was to work closely with the other two UX designers as well as the UX researcher on building ideas and concepts together while also figuring out requirements and features to first work with. This project had a lot of room for us to explore and research to define key points that a user might go through from being outside of the gym to working out inside the gym. The whole ecosystem involved a great deal of the Internet of Things in terms of wearable devices being connected in real-time to station displays, leaderboards and a website or web app. We needed to focus on aspects of this ecosystem by starting with the environment, displays and types of fitness workouts that would be simple to track but would also be effective for the user's goals. We also worked closely with the client on figuring out the most feasible core of their first prototype as a whole based on research and requirements on fitness equipment and workouts, how many gym-goers at a time, how long the sessions should be, and which types of wearable technology we can start with.</p>
	    <p>Along with brainstorming within a group of designers and researchers, I designed concepts for the station displays while also doing some competitive analysis. I also assisted the UX researcher in planning the first round of testing on the concepts, including finding an appropriate setting since the ergonomics needed to be considered between the user working out and viewing the real-time data in front of them.</p>
