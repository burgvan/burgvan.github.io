	    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text"><p>This is a project I worked on while working with Plastic Mobile. The Avion Passport mobile application is for RBC Avion customers or non-customers to have access to Avion Holiday Boutique's services at selected malls such as gift wrapping services and valet parking. The main purpose of the application is to drop off gifts at the boutique to get wrapped which will give the user an estimated time in real-time to pick up the wrapped gifts within the same day. The app has been built by Plastic Mobile last year and this year the client wanted some improvements. I worked on some usability improvements on the app; major ones were mainly the countdown on the home screen, the flow of ordering gift wrapping, and the flow of different states of gift lists.</p>

	    <p>The tablet scanner is an extension to the Avion Passport mobile application as an employee-facing app for employees at Avion Holiday Boutique. The purpose of this is to keep track of statistics on how many RBC Avion customers and guests are coming into the boutique and using their services. I designed it from scratch by following business requirements and creating wireframes that later were visually designed by a designer with many iterations and testing. The native application works on iOS and Android while the scanner app only works on iOS.</p></div>
