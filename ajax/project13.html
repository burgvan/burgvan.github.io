	    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text"><p>While working with Plastic Mobile, I was working closely with the art director on designing the Scene mobile app to create a smooth user experience that will act as an extension to the Cineplex mobile app. The purpose of this mobile app is to attain Scene members and attract new members by providing a quick and accessible way to do the following: digitally purchase items with Scene, view accumulated points from purchasing movie tickets and other past purchases, learn how to earn more points and save money on future purchases by using the earned points.</p>

	    <p>The client wanted to only focus on adding the ability to earn and redeem SCENE points by also offering rewards and special offers to all users and to some special targeted users. The process with this project was very lean where I worked side by side with the art director on designing solutions by sketching out wireframes and collaborating on ideas as a team, iterating designs through ad hoc testing, confirming and meeting business requirements. We went through scrum phases weekly. I also conducted quick usability testing on the home screen and the "offers" screen to validate whether use of language was appropriate as well as the visual cues. Language such as "redeem" and statements on how many rewards for how many points needed to be iterated and tested. After a scrum phase was completed and approved, I then finished documenting the designs and their functionalities for the developers to use as a guide to start developing the corresponding phase.</p>

	    <p>The app is now free to check out on both Google Store and Apple Store.</p>
