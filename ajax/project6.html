	    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text"><p>During my time at Algonquin College, I had the privilege to work with <a href="http://www.rideshark.com/features/Home.aspx" target="_blank">RideShark</a> that owns a web application that encourages the public to use different forms of sustainable transportation. I created a high-level design of the mobile version of the web app which later on has progressed into the design and development stages.</p>
	   	<p>The process was quick with weekly brainstorming sessions with a UX expert and professor SuCheng Lee. We realized that we needed to narrow down the experience with common long-term and short-term goals that the user would want to reach to within frictionless paths. This meant we needed to strip away some of the features for the mobile app that were used in the web app since the mobile app's objectives were to have an account, message potential ride sharers, and schedule ride shares with others going to the same destinations.</p></div>
