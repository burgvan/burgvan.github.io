	    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text"><p>This is a responsive redesign of Centrum's website that I helped designed when I was working for Mirum as a freelancer. Mirum's client Pfizer wanted a brand new user experience while keeping Centrum's brand in mind.</p> 
	    
	    <p>The goal was to retain customers and bring in potential new customers to learn about the benefits of their multivitamins, as well as to learn which multivitamin would be the best for them. I worked in the initial stages of the project on re-structuring the information architecture, creating new designs, and conducting some research for the "Products" browsing page and "Find Your Centrum" tool. I also continued to ensure the matrices for the product results matching with the filter values and product categories were updated based on business requirements. From the research that I initiatively conducted on the new "Find Your Centrum" concept, the hypothesis of ordering the flow from age range, gender, health considerations, and health benefits resulted in a much narrow search for a user who needs assistance in finding the "right" product for them. The "Products" browsing page improved by prioritizing filters the best way for the user to narrow down results, as well as adding the "health considerations" filters as dietary restrictions that some products support. This way it narrows the results even further. Another aspect that changed based on some quick usability testing I initiatively conducted on the previous version of the website, was that a user who was 50+ didn't bother selecting the "Centrum 50+" main category, and instead used the age filter. Filters that didn't support other selected filters were also not cancelling out which made the experience difficult especially for an older audience.</p> 
	    
	    <p>Along the way, I did a few revisions on a few key landing pages near the end of the project as well as writing the functional specifications for the developers.</p>
