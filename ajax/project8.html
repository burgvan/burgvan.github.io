	    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text"><p><a href="http://personalneurodevices.com/" target="_blank">Personal Neuro Devices</a> developed a mobile meditation application called <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/transcend-meditation/id615817923?mt=8" target="_blank">Transcend</a> and it connects to a NeuroSkyâ€™s MindWave Mobile Headset that reads the user's brain activity on whether they are feeling calm or not. The purpose of this is to give users real feedback about the quality and duration of their meditation sessions. It also provides guides and awards to encourage users to continue the whole meditation experience.</p>
		<p>My team and I at Algonquin College had the privilege to plan and conduct research on their product. We recruited and scheduled targeted participants, planned and created a test script. There were 6 sessions which were also recorded. Overall, there were a mix of positive and negative experiences that were performed by the testers as well as some thoughtful feedback on mainly the app itself. The headset was for the most part easy to use with a smooth connection to the app.</p>
