	    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text"><p>Being a customer of GoodFood, a Canadian meal kit delivery service that delivers fresh, local ingredients, I really do enjoy their service, however, I strongly feel that they could potentialy use a mobile application as an extension to their brand. I then decided, for fun, to start designing a mobile application version from a high-level of their website along with some improvements to the user experience.</p>
	    <p>The first step I took was to evaluate the flow on their website as a logged in member to identify any pain points during key scenarios such as selecting meals from receiving reminders. This way I would keep these pain points in mind while designing the mobile version. I mapped out the current information architecture and analyzed how it can be improved to make the mobile experience smoother. I also wanted to keep in mind that usually mobile experiences should be light enough to allow users to perform key tasks such as editing the account and customer's schedule/plan, as well as making meal selections, and making the customer aware that GoodFood is always up-to-date by providing customer reviews of meals and articles.</p>
	    <p>So far I have designed the "My Basket" screen where I sketched out wireframes for it first and then visualy designed it along with adding micro-interactions that would make the user experience better during the meal selection process. I also included latest iOS notification functionality that would encourage users to continue to be loyal customers and perform tasks easily.</p>
	    <p>As whenever I have more down time, I will continue working on this personal project and showcase the full app design. I have had fun working on this so far and it is also a way for me to always freshen up my visual design expertise.</p>
