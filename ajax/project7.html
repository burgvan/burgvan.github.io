	    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text"><p>I worked with FCB/SIX in Toronto for an automotive project as the UX Lead, which involved in developing a new experience for the customers of this brand. It is part of the onboarding experience for customers after purchasing a new vehicle to receive a digital welcome kit that is also personalized based on their purchase.</p>

	    <p>As this project was on a very tight deadline, I had to rely on past insights from market research to understand customer purchase behaviour and preferences for luxury vehicles. Once I had an understanding of the basis of the customer journey to an extent from these insights along with the idea, which I assume would be validated further after going live, I fleshed out the customer journey to ensure that the team and client understand what exactly we're building from a user perspective. I also conducted competitive research for inspiration and things to avoid, while I was collaboratively working with the creative team on creating concepts for the responsive website. I also proposed the information architecture to the client which they approved and we used it, along with the customer journey, as our guide to creating the concepts fluidly. The approach to design was iterative and I used InVision for prototyping the concepts for quick feedback. We had weekly meetings to discuss any updates on requirements, approvals, and blockers which we had several, unfortunately, due to lack of resources and assets for the creative team to build on. This did, unfortunately, result in pausing the development of this version of the project.</p>

	    <p>Nonetheless, it was a great experience working with the FCB/SIX team on this project and I hope they will successfully launch it.</p>
