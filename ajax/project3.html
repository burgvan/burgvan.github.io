	    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text"><p>This was another project I worked on during my time at Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat where I developed a new concept for the <a href="http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pd-dp/gr-rg/index-eng.asp" target="_blank">Proactive Disclosure</a>. Its current design is not user-friendly and does not guide users with a smooth filtering approach. I focused on the visualization of the data and the search design as part of the workflow. I decided to implement a faceted search that is also somewhat guided to not overwhelm users with too many options. I used an iterative approach to my design where I developed and refined the design based on feedback and evaluation. I designed two versions of the interface and facilitated a short A/B participatory testing/workshop at CodeFest 2014 where I managed to have people who were attending the conference to take the time to analyze two versions of the data filtering interface. They were largely printed and posted on a wall, and people wrote comments and ideas on sticky notes, as well as voting which one they would prefer to use.</p>
	    <p>After deciding which interface would be preferred based on feedback at CodeFest and from a Github community, I made changes and documented the design which ended up getting deployed as a working prototype by a fellow developer with whom I discussed how the design works. I have also proposed the design to various stakeholders and the concept might be getting worked on for Open Data.</p></div>
