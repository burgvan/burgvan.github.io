The client wanted to only focus on adding the ability to earn and redeem SCENE points by also offering rewards and special offers to all users and to some special targeted users. The process with this project was very lean where I worked side by side with the art director on design solutions by sketching out wireframes and collaborating on ideas as a team, while also asking many questions on business requirements as we went through each scrum phase. I also conducted quick usability testings on complex screens that needed to be validated. After a scrum phase was completed and approved, I then finished documenting the designs and their functionalities for the developers to use as a guide so they can start developing that phase.</p>

	    <p>This app is still currently being developed and tested before it's released.</p></div>
